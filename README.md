# NeuroDataHack: 1-day HBHL mini-hackathon

These are some of the code snippets from the participants of the 1-day mini-hackathon organized by Healthy Brains, Healthy Lives at McGill University. The repository was created for the hackathon participants to practice Git + GitHub use.

Three teams of graduate students in neuroscience and related fields collaboratively explored three publicly available datasets:

## Teams:

- [Alzheimers + MRI](#team-1-brain-volume-in-dementia)
- [Suicide rates 1985-2016](#team-2-deaths-by-suicide-in-1985-2016)
- [Rhythm + EEG](#team-3-eeg-signatures-of-auditory-rhythm-processing)

### Team 1: Brain volume in dementia
